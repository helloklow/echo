# ECHO

ECHO is a React app for pilots to maintain a safe and secure digital backup of their logbook. Built to emulate a standard logbook for easy and efficient use, ECHO stores each pilot's flight log privately and conveniently. No need to dig through old logbooks in search of flight notes - From first flight to final landing, ECHO logs it all.
